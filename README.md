All code contained within the source files have been directly && indirectly sourced from the book. Some examples contain code used from solutions to questions I've had such as "how to use datetime utils within Java", etc.

*NOTE: For information regarding the structural integrity of this github repository (compilation unit's organized into folders via numerical names based on the chapters) this will be added with the "git" command at a later date.*
